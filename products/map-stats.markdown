#Statistics from the Education of Puerto Rico

[According to the 2000 Census](http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf), 60.0% of the population in Puerto Rico attained a high school degree or higher level of education, and 18.3% has a bachelor's degree or higher.

Completion of high school is important for employability and longevity. People who received their high school diploma or GED were 37.5 percent less likely to be unemployed than others according to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Management/Sales-managers.htm). In addition, individuals who do not receive a diploma are more likely to: require public assistance; have health problems; and engage in criminal activity.

Our project works to convert data into actionable insights for the policy decision makers. This was made during the TechSummitPr hackathon on June 6, 2013.

- Python ([Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [SimpleJson](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/))
- Javascript (D3.js, [AtlasPR](http://miguelrios.github.io/atlaspr), NVD3.js)
- Theme borrowed from PixelLogic's [prototype](pixelogic.co/c/bgc/www/)
- [API](http://www.pixelogicpr.com/PRYouthAPI) from Institute for Youth Development and PixelLogic
