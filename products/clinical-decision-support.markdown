#Survey Administration Dashboard

The comorbidity survey was designed to encourage patients to complete the survey the night before their clinic visit. As a backup option, clinicians have tablets to allow patients to enter data while in the waiting room.

When the survey is completed, the clinician will be able to see the results and calculations.

Cancer surgeons recommend surgery options to patients based on their mortality rates from comorbidities. At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, my work helped clinicians recommend treatment options based on patient information.


The interfaces highlighted on this page shows how some of the data is represented graphically to aid health professionals in their workflow.
