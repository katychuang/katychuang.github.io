###Interaction Design
I designed surveys for epidemiological and biostatistics research studies. My role at MSKCC included organizing the content to encourage completion of surveys as well as improving the data collection workflow.

##Features:
- Question and answer branching through the survey.
- Data validation of survey answers.
- Administrative dashboard for managing survey enrollment.
- Displaying health risks graphically.

##Technical Environment:

- Microsoft Visio
- C#/HTML5/JS/MSSQL
