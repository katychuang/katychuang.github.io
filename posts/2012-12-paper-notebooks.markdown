Spent approximately the last 24hrs (on and off) analyzing paper notebooks casually to figure out an organizational system for capturing ideas. Read a number of blog posts extolling merits of moleskine notebooks, moleskine alternatives, digital methods, and even blogs showing examples of filled notebooks.

Truth is, note-taking is a habit as much as a system of tools. I admit to not having a very good method for the former nor invested in very good tools for the latter. That is why even though I've spent so many hours perusing online information, I don't have much of a summary beyond a simple list of what I could use in my 'system'. In a way, blogging about this is my way of extracting knowledge from my brain and putting it in a slightly more permanent format. Blogging is good for sharing with the world. Paper notebooks.. not so much unless I find a way to digitize its contents.

In a way my interest in notebooks stems from days of library science studies where we learned about book binding and the proper handling of books... but mostly, after reading Egron Guba's writing on Naturalistic Inquiry, I feel inspired to quickly jot down some 'findings' from my research on paper notebooks :)

<address>Table 1: Usability Criteria for Paper Notebooks</address>
<table style="font-size:10pt;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Aspect</td>
<td>Common Terms</td>
<td>Notes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Size</td>
<td>pocket, medium, large</td>
<td>smaller for portability, larger for more space (i.e. sketches)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cover hardness</td>
<td>paper, cahier, softbound, flexibound, hardbound</td>
<td>harder covers better for daily use as paper ones would start to show wear and tear earlier</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Paper qualities</td>
<td>acid, paper weight (gsm), color, recycled, thickness, perforated</td>
<td>some good for holding heavier inks to avoid bleed through, others good for different weather conditions (rite in the rain). 'sketchbooks' tend to have heavier paper.perforated is great if you need to remove pages</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Documentation Purpose</td>
<td>plain, lined/ruled, grid, dot grid, square, prelined</td>
<td>paper pre-structured with lines or dots depending on what you'll be jotting ideas for - art, writing, research, etc</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Look &amp; Feel</td>
<td>theme, style, color</td>
<td>classic combo is black leather cover with white-ish pages. Some brands focus on rainbow colors (paperthinks), some on pretty covers (paperblanks). leather is classier. some are solid colors, some are printed covers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Binding</td>
<td>spiral, stitch bound</td>
<td>spiral for folding book in half. Stitch binding for opening and closing, laying pages flat. Other bindings for a flat look when closed on bookshelf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">*Specific Use</td>
<td>fashionary for fashion sketches, travel journals to document travels, recipe journals for cooking, planners, etc.</td>
</tr>
