Looking back at accomplishments, 2013 was a phenomenal year. Life happens at a much faster pace when you are not writing a book.  Contributions to open source soared this year, as I learned to deploy apps written in python, javascript, and haskell. Was able to share some of these tips through workshops. What helped increase effectiveness of others helping me was communicating through through [decentralized version control system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) (i.e. Github) and mindful authoring of [commit messages](http://stackoverflow.com/a/43631/1470114). 

**Open Data Applications**

The CIO of Puerto Rico government uses this app from time to time as it shows reports of [education statistics](http://puertorico.herokuapp.com/) from Open Data source. Only found out because I heard through a friend about complaints that the heroku server was down. It's really cool to make something that others find useful. This project was made during TechSummitPR, a fun day filled with learning Django + D3.js deployment and making new friends. Looking back, Flask would've been appropriate.

To this day it boggles my mind that some data scientists believe in a narrow definition of data science work - creating new models to interpret data or producing a chart. They do not believe plugging the results into a communicable form as "true science". Being able to produce a D3.js graphic is not quite enough for communicating to a broad audience, which can include people without domain knowledge. Science is about reproducibility. Scientists' obligation to society is disseminating knowledge - based on good presentation of material.

What I loved about this project, was the ability to create a chart for Spanish-speaking population using open source + open data without fluent Spanish skills. Highlighting a province was so simple `fill:red` yet conveys intuitive meaning to all language speakers. 

**Building a community website**

Initially signed up to volunteer my time to work on the redesign of the [PyData.org](http://pydata.org) conference website. With minimal experience in django development, it was a challenge to build a community website - holy cow, right? That's a lot of moving parts. Regardless of the effort and time involved, pursuit of this mighty goal was motivated by prioritizing community building efforts. I wanted the conference attendees to get a good impression of the community, and feel welcomed and part of the community. Since many of their first impression is through the website, it's important to try my best.

As I only had exposure to theory of community websites at that point, I dove into the deep end to figure out the backend first. There's a lot to consider on the front end as well. Conference individuals tend to check the schedule on their phone, yet read about the speakers on their computer before the conference. Informal usability tests are used, since I had a super lean agile method. Although being the primary person contributing to the full stack of production code takes 24/7 attention, most of the hours are in the middle of the night, weekends and lunch hours. *Tip:* Pad  development time estimates to be on the safe side.

It was my first time working with Linux, and being the go-to person for all production related questions.

**UIs for Streamlining tedious work**

I rebuilt an admin console, which was [featured in Pando Daily](http://pando.com/2013/08/22/boxed-is-more-than-an-costco-delivery-app-its-a-mobile-commerce-platform-built-by-mobile-gaming-experts/), but due to contract stipulation the company gets the credit in the news. Regardless, it was a wonderful opportunity to  learn how to work with Node.js/Express/Backbone/MongoDb and take over dual role of product design and front end developer on a team of 12 back end developers.

The person managing inventory needed visual cues to track movement, to figure out what to buy, and also needed better ways to enter product information. It was a roll back to library school training. Not only did I help improve the ontology, introduce metadata standards, I built the system where it'd be housed.

Best advice I can give other coders who want to make a difference in the world is to is to reach outside your comfort zone, help those who don't have the same background. Take on new challenges often. Volunteering for projects was a great way to get hands-on experience and exposure to new techniques that others use. The pressure of someone expecting you to build a feature helps keep you on schedule. 

The main takeaway from the year is to have a good set up for working, from having the right equipment to removing distractions all help with productivity. I also find value in discussing ideas with others as talking it out will eliminate the bad ideas right away. Spend consistent time to learn new skills - repetitive practice makes for helping your brain remember things. 

**From Outsider to Community Leader**

I am still relatively new to open source community, having spent the last decade in the ivory tower. Many a lonely day passed while writing [dissertation on health social media](http://katychuang.wordpress.com/dissertation) and [publishing to academic journals](http://katychuang.wordpress.com/publications).  Does anyone outside of academia read them or find this work useful? Such questions made me look for a community to be part of, to contribute to with more hands on approach. Nothing charges up an ENFP like a mission in helping underdogs succeed:

* Evening out the gender ratios in tech, particularly introducing diversity to scientific computing.
* Teaching basic computer literacy skills, including installations & git commands.

There's unfortunately no glamour in helping those in need but they are the ones who need it the most, and sometime they are too shy to ask for help.  To figure out what your community needs, listen to them. Listen to the problems they complain about and then find a way to connect them with the answer or solution.  

**Big Data in Fashion**

This hobby project started as an intervention of sorts by two separate roommates pointed out the value of being female in NYC and having a high level of personal grooming and presentation. As most academics, I was so focused on research that I would daily be wearing mismatched, ill-fitting, non-flattering clothing. I needed a solution for quickly ramping up fashion knowledge; enter big data.

[Blogged about some of the technical project details early in the year](big-data-in-fashion). The research and study involved led to building a website to [forecast peoples sentiment about fashion items](http://katychuang.pythonanywhere.com/style) to crowdsource answers for my fashion questions. What is appropriate work wear? What is hipster? How do so many girls my age know to wear striped shirt with skinny jeans and knee length boots? Where does the informaton originate from? What are the cultural values for clothing items? 

This project would have been heavily based on natural language processing. To build a  controlled vocabulary learning set, compiled a [pinterest board with the many styles terms available](http://www.pinterest.com/katychuang/style-guides/). This project would also require mapping conversations to break down the geographical differences as well. There's unfortunately not much geo-location information on twitter, but with a big enough dataset you can see that people tweet from all over the world about fashion.

Cherry on top to the experience for speaking at PyData was chatting with a data scientist from One Kings Lane! Retail forecasting is legit!

If you're on your journey in the tech space and need help, check out  [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com), or relevant IRC channel, mailing lists, or your local Hacker Hours. There are so many nice people in the tech community but they tend to be introverted so you need to be proactive in reaching out to them. The best way to contact them is through technology, perhaps their twitter. If your question can't be asked in 140 char then maybe you need to work on asking a specific question :) 

**Helping friends through troubled times** 

Sometimes friends needs help resetting their life after a bad breakup. I take them running outside and make them too wearied to mope - this summer I coached friends from couch potatoes to 5k runners.

Last but not least, most memorable of this year is friends ask *me* for fashion advice! Guess when you talking about matching your outfit to text editor, it's saying something.
