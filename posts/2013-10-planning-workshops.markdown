Recently planned a number of workshops to help <a href="http://pyladies.com">pyladies</a> learn how to get started with coding, source control, and social coding. Because the number of signups reached between 50-60, and over 20 showed up in an under-represented demographic, it seems like I stumbled onto something right!

<em>Disclaimer:</em> It wasn't easy to do it all by myself -- it would be a lot more manageable to plan an event with a group of folks to share the tasks. In the worst case it is still possible to pull off a successful event, especially if you have the right tools to stay organized, like <a href="http://getblimp.com">Blimp</a> shown in the screenshot below. Some of my tips for finding space is specific to NYC, where space usually gets booked up beforehand. I don't know if there exists a good guide for planning tech coding workshops out there, there probably are... these are just my thoughts from the grassroots perspective to help other software developers take leadership roles in their community.

**Project management tools are helpful! :) Blimp gifted NYC PyLadies with free PRO account to help with planning more events. Great UI/UX for managing a big to do list.**

###2 weeks or more before the event....
It's helpful to start with a general topic in mind and shave it down, like the way Michaelangelo can take a block of stone and chip away at it until it looks good. This way you know what the event will be about.

**1. Find a venue.** You can reach out to local coworking spaces, startups, companies, etc to tell them about your mission and how they can help you by contributing space for a couple of hours. Start reaching out as soon as possible to book space, so that you know how many seats are available and if transportation is convenient. It could also be helpful to reach out to companies just to let them know you'll have a need in the near future and compile a database for your group to reach out to in the future. A good venue will have good space design, similar to how you'd pick a hotel room for it's noise level, lighting, whether it's comfortable, and if there's restrooms, easy to get into, has wifi, etc.

You can also look for sponsors to help with the budget for the event, if you're going to provide food.

**2. Decide on a workshop format.** Figure out whether you want a casual hackathon style or formal lecture style event. I generally like to schedule 2 hrs in the evening, because it is convenient for people who work full time jobs. Also, the for volunteers this is max 3 hrs spent setting up, instructing, cleaning. For the attendees a minimum of at least 1 hr learning and 1 hr social bonding with peers. Learning to code well is very much based on association of concepts and picking up on the vernacular and conventions so the social environment helps in implicit ways as attendees work on introductory exercises together. Once you know how to code in a language, then it's easy to pick up another because you learned the skills along the way to become an independent problem solver. As a beginner the number of choices in how to tackle things is what makes a problem seem impossible so these workshops could be designed to decrease the frustrations.

Regardless of format you'll need to know approximately how many volunteers (TA's) are needed for instruction or mentorship. Beginners have a lot of questions and some of them can be very custom to their scenario (i.e. OSX 10.9 introduces compiling errors because of the C libraries that come shipped with the OS software, but not every student will have that version of OS), and also it helps to group attendees into smaller groups. I like to plan for the ratio of 1 volunteer to 3 attendees, in case some cannot show up last minute and it extends unto 1:5.

If you're not sure what would be a good decision, make mini polls for each decision. They can be casual, like bouncing an idea off a friend. People are quite receptive to being asked their opinion, so don't be shy. Some other questions might include, do you want to charge attendees or if you want to be selective about who is allowed to attend. I don't like to charge for PyLadies events because it presents yet another barrier.

**3. Marketing.** Write down your description of the event as you vision it, what you expect attendees to accomplish, what they should bring, what they'll get out of attending, etc. Meetup.com works great for this because the event page has comments to let folks discuss the event before, during, and after event; another helpful website to use is Eventbrite.com, which does not require your attendees to be part of a group. You can also go with Facebook events though I don't see that happening as much for tech events. Once you have an "event" set up on one of these sites, share the link. I usually send a tweet out once a week until the week before, and then every 2-3 days until the day with different messages to show that folks will get out of the event. You can ask for volunteers to help with this as well.

On social media you can use hashtags and in case you don't know, it's the #topic looking things so that your announcement is easy to find. Tell your friends about the event you're hosting. Sometimes folks are excited enough about the event to help you share the word.
<h3>The week before the event....</h3>
<strong>4. Don't let the ball drop.</strong> You'll see how many people signed up. By now you should have at least some instructors or volunteers signed up, and you can either reach out for more volunteers or signups. The week before an event usually is a daily check of how the numbers change and adjust accordingly to estimate the same ratio of volunteer:attendee. Based off my experience you generally can take the 50% cutoff at this point to use as a metric for the show rate day off, but it's not always true.

<strong>5. Topic should be fairly well formulated now.</strong> You've had at least a week to think about how the content should be delivered, and by who. The speaker(s) should prepare some written material to share with the group. This could be in the form of slides, a github repo, a gist, a web page, wiki page, etc etc. There are minor pros/cons of each specific one but the main idea is to make it easy to access so that people can follow along more easily through the 2 hr workshop. If you have the attendees work on exercises, it helps them to have the instruction steps written down.

<strong>6. Reminders.</strong> Send a reminder/info email to your volunteers with some details about the agenda, the topic, etc. You want them to know what to expect during the event so that they can be their most helpful.  If they need to prepare anything, let them know that as well. If you are presenting and you're not sure if your material is correct, now is the time to get feedback and improve before the event day. Also send reminder to participants about the event. A lot of folks lead busy lives and communication is the key to getting a group to go together in one direction.
<h3>1 Day before...</h3>
<strong>7. Make any last minute decisions.</strong> This can include reminding attendees to bring power strips, their laptop/charger, refreshments, etc. Any special instructions for accessing the event space, or any lecture material to peruse beforehand.

Refreshments: I suggest this the day before (or earlier) because some research may be involved in figuring out whether there are extra charges for delivery, or cutoff time for large orders. A friend shared with me an easy recipe for Sangria. Get a bottle of wine, a bottle of sprite, plastic cups, ice cubes, and let folks make their own mix. Will say that alcohol is only suggested if your event is for 21+ :) Making it potluck style would be fun too! Everyone can chip in like it's a housewarming party. Makes it easier for everyone to break the ice with warm food in their bellies.

<strong>8. Guestlist.</strong> If the space you're going to has security at the front door, you should send a guest list to speed up the check in process. I notice this is more of an issue in Manhattan than any other city.
<h3>Day of...</h3>
<strong>9. Showtime!</strong> There are a number of things to keep on top of:

Since workshops attendees are often folks who want to learn something new, it could be a first exposure to a topic. You want to make it a welcoming environment for them by showing good hospitality. Greet everyone who comes in, smile! Help introduce folks to each other. To get a conversation going, you can ask them how they found out about your event or group, what they want to accomplish. These are pretty easy to answer open ended questions.

Helping attendees with questions are a bit like the whack a mole game. You as the host of the event should circulate the room and keep a watch for anyone who looks like they are struggling or frustrated and help them ease that. An effective way to be able to keep your focus on scanning the room but also help the attendees is to find out if it's a question with short answer or longer answer. If it's short, I'll help them there and if it's longer then I'll find a volunteer who's free to help out.

Be aware that the projector may fail, the internet my not work, the restroom may run out of toilet paper, etc. Have backup options to all these to reduce the time spent on fixing technical difficulties.
<h2>Extra tips</h2>
I like to take photographs of events to remind attendees the good times. It helps keep the momentum going in between events.

I decided to plan a series of 3 workshops all at once, with spacing of 2 weeks in between because the three are cornerstones of getting started: installation, source control, and knowing how to think in bits!
<h2>Thanks for reading!</h2>
Please show your appreciation by planning your events and telling me how it went! You don't have to be an expert at programming to plan an event that helps others. It is VERY VALUABLE to the community even if all you do is help them engage in new ways to foster discussions and new friendships.
