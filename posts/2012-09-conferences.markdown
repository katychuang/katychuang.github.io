Busy, busy month attending a conference, recruiting members and sponsors for NYC Pyladies. Also was trying to get settled into new apartment.
<h2>DjangoCon 2012</h2>
Was incredibly fortunate enough to have attendance at <a href="http://www.djangocon.us/">Djangocon</a> 2012 funded by the generous PyLadies sponsors. It was very inspiring to meet web developers, to see their work, and discuss work environments. Every I met was so friendly and so helpful. I even learned to create a django web app!! :)

I took what I learned and over the next few weeks to start creating <a href="https://github.com/katychuang/Python-Fashion-Forecaster">fashion forecasting tools</a> I dreamt of long ago. Never really thought it possible until hearing about REST/Soap/jSON services and how they integrate with a web framework. All I knew before attending DjangoCon, was that Python is really good for text analysis because of it's ability to parse regular expressions. <em>Little did I know!</em>

In fact, so incredibly inspired by the supportive community of PyLadies that I'm collaborating with another PyLady in submitting a talk to <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/">PyCon 2013</a>!
<h2>DataGotham</h2>
Also attended DataGotham, a data science conference in the city.

<h2>NYC PyLadies</h2>
With the Python community, the saying, "Help is there if you ask for it" is very true. I am so fortunate to work with talented ladies (Zanab H. and Emily C.) who stepped up into leadership roles in this chapter! They're amazing :)

So we had a succesful event the middle of the month, hosted by Pivotal Labs. A number of companies have since offered sponsorship for space. Wow! Thank you tech community for helping us ladies out!! :) The more help we get, the more we can contribute knowledge and guidance to our members! We have a list of really good ideas.. and will be rolling them out in the next few weeks/months as we get the plans together. Exciting!! The group is starting to take a life on it's own!! Yay! Incredibly uplifting. Although, to be honest, after attending the NY Data Business Meetup (NYDBM) hosted by Bloomberg, there is a long way to go for events that have over 300+ attendance. Some day, some day..

Took a trip to the Bronx zoo, before summer completely ends. Most days I feel like this polar bear.. if only life were so relaxed, huh?

Not just building web apps in spare time, but also building shelves =p
