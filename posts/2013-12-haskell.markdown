Increasing fluency with Haskell and writing essays are a couple of my goals this year. To meet both objectives, I'm using [hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) to convert markdown files into blog articles for this website.

There are quite a few code examples and tutorials available so instead of writing about getting started.... let's look at how 'Hakyll' fares as a search term on Google's search engine:

<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&q=hakyll&date=today+12-m&cmpt=geo&content=1&cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&export=5&w=600&h=330"></script>

Another goal, is to become quicker at producing d3 charts, so here we go with a simple one that takes Github API information of recent community events (limited to 30) of this repository:

<p data-height="473" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="JeGjL" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/katychuang/pen/JeGjL'>JeGjL</a> by Dr. Kat (<a href='http://codepen.io/katychuang'>@katychuang</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Looks like being the main contributor to an open source repo requires a lot of attention!

The javascript was verbose - probably could be refactored to fewer lines, but so far I see Haskell a clear advantage with the "maybe" type and also better handling of date string formats.
