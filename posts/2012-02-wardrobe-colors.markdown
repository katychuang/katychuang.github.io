Lately i've been undergoing a process of editing my wardrobe again to have few clothing items that all work together. I move around a lot and believe in living minimally.  Won't go too much detail about that, Instead I'll describe a summary of colors from editing.

Edit #1 (2011) - When I first moved to NYC, my ex-model roommate helped me choose some colors that complement my skin tone. She taught me that warm colors complement golden (yellow-based) skin. For the past several months, I basically wore outfits with these colors. Over the course of time I ended up going to these outfits over and over (3 outfits for 5 day work week). I stayed on the casual end of business casual so that I could wear knee-length boots for the cold weather.

Unfortunately (or fortunately) I learned quickly that cat hair loves to attach to dark clothing!

Edit #2 (2012) - Played with ivory and peach colors on top to match with black pants.

...better, but black still seemed too dark! not to mention it still attracted cat hair.

This weekend, I luckily stumbled upon a french company <strong>Comptoir Des Cotonniers</strong> while strolling through Bloomingdale's. One look at their clothing racks made me stop. The signs saying "50% percent reduced" made me walk over to take a closer look. I went towards a rust colored dress, it was a very simple style, which would allow any combination of accesories.

Long story short, I have these new colors to work with!

Unfortunately Navy pants still attract cat hair, but I will have to live with that, since I typically don't wear light color pants until summer season (between Memorial Day and Labor Day).

<em>Side note about french clothing</em>- I love that it's high quality textures, simple and elegant (effortless sexy), well shaped for curvy petite body. I will be back for this brand.
