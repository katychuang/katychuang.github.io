title: In a dress, at a hackathon

Hackathons are intense sessions of coding that can last a day or more, with a competition component. <a href="http://apihackdayny.eventbrite.com/">#APIHackDay</a> was a one day event in NYC held at @AlleyNYC on 7th Ave in Garmet District between Times Square and Herald Square.

You can see the schedule below, it was about 12 hrs long, mostly sitting down in front of a machine. Getting up by 7am to get ready for a hackathon.. most girls would say no thanks to dressing up because of the effort involved. I disagree, it's not a lot of work to wear a dress and cute accessories. For me, going to the garment district is more than enough reason to dress nicely! :)

During the hackathon, I worked with Twitter api and HotWire &amp; Yelp APIs for the conference website I'm building, which was not a contender for the prizes that judge the use of APIs available from <a href="http://www.twilio.com/" target="_blank">Twilio</a>, <a href="http://sendgrid.com/" target="_blank">SendGrid</a>, <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://ordr.in/">Ordr.in</a>, <a href="https://singly.com/">Singly</a>, <a href="http://developer.ikanow.com/">IKANOW</a>, <a href="http://www.tokbox.com/opentok/api">OpenTok</a> and <a href="http://www.mashery.com/" target="_blank">Mashery</a>. (will add more details &amp; screenshots about my project later)
<p style="text-align:center;">My outfit was simple, I'll break it down by different components.

Made a set with Polyvore to show the overall look. I could not find some of the correct items on their site when building the collection so I ended up selecting designer items when I really have a lot more budget items :)

<strong>Outfit</strong>: In the wintertime I prefer layers. I wore an H&amp;M navy blue t-shirt dress with a Comptoir Des Cotonniers Tunic Sweater over it (dark green). (Sometimes I wear a belt over this combo but did not for the hackathon). I wore black American Apparel winter leggings to keep my legs warm.

<strong>Hair/Makeup:</strong> Pinned my bangs to the side to avoid distractions, and the rest down. For makeup, I went for a natural look. Concealer + foundation for a smooth base, a peachy pink blush for contour. For the eye area I filled in brows with eyebrow pencil (dark brown) and two types of eye liner and mascara. Wore glasses (eyes get dry looking at computer screen so I avoid contacts at hackathons)

<strong>Accessories:</strong> I wore a short gold chain necklace, a forever 21 cross body purse (I like to use crossbodies because I can take my phone/wallet with me to the bathroom instead of lugging everything), and my favorite pair of comfy flat knee high boots.

Inspiration for this post...

The first ever hackathon I attended last fall was in the Flatiron District in Manhattan, for the Android NFC hackathon.

I had worn a little black dress with a scarf to keep warm with elf boots. A couple of friends complimented me on the combination (see above). I had a Calvin Klein black summer dress (crocheted neckline) with Comptoir des Cotonnier items (black cardigan, scarf, belt) and Dolce Vita microsuede boots.

Last week I mentioned to the same friend that I'm attending yet another hackathon and she was very interested in what I'd wear this time, so here it is darling!
