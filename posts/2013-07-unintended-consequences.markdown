title: Stories of Unintended Consequences
tags: beauty
---

This morning while reading up on news, I see yet another vanity related story. Folks are getting plastic surgery to improve their looks, to improve their chances of marrying well. My first reaction, "<em>oh boy... if only folks thought a bit more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences">unintended consequences</a>.</em>" Unintended consequences are outcomes from purposeful action that are not intended, could be positive or negative. Usually noticed and regretted when negative.

<a href="http://on.mash.to/1dmONNP">Plastic surgery for marriage related reasons</a>, seems like a great idea for getting a better deal but lying never helps you prosper. Your spouse could feel betrayed and sue you for false pretenses. <a href="http://bit.ly/U2hOEz">The judge could very well side with your spouse</a>. These days plastic surgery is becoming more common. In the last century, there were many stories of  technology design success and failures, documented in <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679747567?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=213733&amp;creative=393185&amp;creativeASIN=0679747567&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;tag=hellodoctorki-20">Why Things Bite Back: Technology and Unintended Consequences</a></strong>.

Back to the beauty part.... What is considered attractive?

I'm reminded of an old article, nearly 5 years ago. A graduate student “taught” a computer how to interpret attractiveness in women. (<a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080404122139.htm">Science Daily</a>) The same year, someone figured out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/fashion/09skin.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">automatic photoshopping using mathematical formulas</a>.
<blockquote>... like the many other attempts to use objective principles or even mathematical formulas to define beauty, this software program raises what psychologists, philosophers and feminists say are complex, even disturbing, questions about the perception of beauty and a beauty ideal.</blockquote>
Can you really quantify feeling/perception? Culture must have an impact on our perceptions, especially when <a href="http://bit.ly/11EUIud">a significant portion of beauty contestants for a country look alike</a>. Beauty varies <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/homo-consumericus/201004/beauty-culture-specific-or-universally-defined">by locality</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/eMU5N">over time</a>, could a computer program adapt to suit the context? Is this software a variant of the thought process by plastic surgeons during consultation? Who would agree with the output of the program? While some folks like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stepford_Wives">Stepford Wives try to look like one ideal</a> (<em>does this remind you of any particular valleys on the west coast?</em>), others <a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2010/08/weirdos_still_a.php">celebrate uniqueness</a> (<em>does this remind you of any major metropolitan cities on the east coast?</em>). <a href="http://jezebel.com/5886159/new-york-fashion-week-is-the-most-diverse-in-ages">Diversity is an important issue in the looks industry</a>. Why are there so many variations of beliefs and <a href="http://www.sirc.org/publik/mirror.html">why do we even care</a>? There are number advantages and disadvantages to supposed attractiveness when it comes to social capital.
<blockquote>Attractive people have distinct advantages in our society. Studies show:
<ul>
    <li>Attractive children are more popular, both with classmates and teachers. Teachers give higher evaluations to the work of attractive children and have higher expectations of them (which has been shown to improve performance).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Attractive applicants have a better chance of getting jobs, and of receiving higher salaries. (one US study found that taller men earned around $600 per inch more than shorter executives.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>In court, attractive people are found guilty less often. When found guilty, they receive less severe sentences.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>The ‘bias for beauty’ operates in almost all social situations – all experiments show we react more favourably to physically attractive people.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>We also believe in the ‘what is beautiful is good’ stereotype – an irrational but deep-seated belief that physically attractive people possess other desirable characteristics such as intelligence, competence, social skills, confidence – even moral virtue. (The good fairy/princess is always beautiful; the wicked stepmother is always ugly)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
Not a surprise that attractiveness is important to our western society. In fact, even throughout history standards of beauty have shifted, from corsets to feet binding.
<blockquote>But although we resemble our ancestors and other cultures in our concern about appearance, there is a difference in degree of concern. Advances in technology and in particular the rise of the mass media has caused normal concerns about how we look to become obsessions.
<ul>
    <li>Thanks to the media, we have become accustomed to extremely rigid and uniform standards of beauty.</li>
    <li>TV, billboards, magazines etc mean that we see ‘beautiful people’ all the time, more often than members of our own family, making exceptional good looks seem real, normal and attainable.</li>
    <li>Standards of beauty have in fact become harder and harder to attain, particularly for women. The current media ideal of thinness for women is achievable by less than 5% of the female population.</li>
    <li>Even very attractive people may not be looking in the mirror out of ‘vanity’, but out of insecurity. We forget that there are disadvantages to being attractive: attractive people are under much greater pressure to maintain their appearance. Also, studies show that attractive people don’t benefit from the ‘bias for beauty’ in terms of self-esteem. They often don’t trust praise of their work or talents, believing positive evaluations to be influenced by their appearance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Different metrics of your genetics.</h3>
<blockquote>Now, let’s get one thing straight so you can relax a bit. You wouldn’t be here unless your ancestors were beautiful. You need to accept the fact that we’re all beautiful; sexual selection guaranteed it, because your ancestors mated with the most beautiful partners. We all have beautiful elements in us; we’re going to talk about ways that we can expose and maximize them.</blockquote>

<div style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2013/03/18/1950s-beauty-pageant-judging-guidelines/">In the 1950's, there were specific standards for selecting winners of a beauty contest</a>:</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:left;">First six show figure flaws, seventh is perfectly proportioned. (1) Shoulders too square. (2) Shoulders too sloping. (3) Hips too wide. (4) Shoulder bones too pronounced. (5) Shoulders and back hunched. (6) Legs irregular, with spaces at calves, knees, thighs. (7) The form divine, needs only a beautiful face.</div></blockquote>

<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;">While those standards could be very strict, apparently in everyday situations among our peers our standards for beauty gravitates toward <strong>average</strong>.  <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/12/091216144141.htm">Scientists conduct experiments to measure the "Golden Ratio" of facial proportions</a>, which turns out to correspond with measures of an average face:</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:left;">

They discovered two "golden ratios," one for length and one for width. Female faces were judged more attractive when the vertical distance between their eyes and the mouth was approximately 36 percent of the face's length, and the horizontal distance between their eyes was approximately 46 percent of the face's width.

<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;">This idea of what is identified as attractive by our brains has been studied for centuries. Our minds actually gravitate towards <strong>average</strong> looking faces because it's easier to process:</div>

<blockquote>In the late 1870s, scientist and eugenicist Sir Francis Galton developed an image of the prototypical “face of crime” by creating composite photos of men convicted of serious offenses.

Though Galton failed to discover anything abnormal in his composite criminal faces, he did find that the resulting visages were shockingly handsome. (The middle face <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/magic/police/galton2.gif" target="_blank">here</a> is the product of 14 criminals.) Studies have since established that people find prototypical faces—those with average features—to be attractive.

A paper published in the September issue of the journal <em>Psychological Science</em> proposes a new explanation for this phenomenon: Prototypical faces are pleasing because they’re easy for the brain to process.</blockquote>

What matters more than your biometric looks, is your presentation, as it tells a lot more about who you are as a person and lifestyle choices (<a href="http://badspot.us/img/PonytailTheory.html">Ponytail Theory</a>)
<a style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" href="http://katychuang.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/tumblr_lembz8rfgk1qcla3bo1_500-scaled500.gif?w=500&h=419"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://katychuang.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/tumblr_lembz8rfgk1qcla3bo1_500-scaled500.gif?w=500&h=419" width="320" height="268" border="0" /></a>Supposedly, these folks signing up for plastic surgery believe that attraction lies in the subconscious metrics. When it comes to partners, men often find women’s taste fickle and unfathomable. But ladies may not be entirely to blame. A <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/17672806">growing body of research suggests</a> that their preference for certain types of male physiognomy may be swayed by things beyond their conscious control—like prevalence of disease or crime—and in predictable ways. In any case, I recommend that before you commit to a life altering beauty decision, <strong>remember two facts</strong>: (1) looks do not hold a marriage together and (2) your perception of yourself tends to skew more negative than friends and family.
