###Understanding User Interaction Patterns in Health Social Media

**Abstract**

Internet users are becoming increasingly social in their online information behavior, as shown by a growing trend of social media adoption in the past decade. Social interaction patterns in this new space are governed by the technological affordances in the infrastructure and membership to the community, yet at times also by individual emotional needs for seeking social support. While this social software technology was invented for a utilitarian purpose of storing group communication, it has now become a place with meaningful interactions. In the consumer health domain, social networking technology and consumer health information needs combine to show that even within the same community, relationships are not expressed in the same manner across various computer mediated communication (CMC) formats. Software design impacts user behavior. The motivation for this research comes from an increasing need to understand the patterns of social interactions online, especially of e-patients using the Internet as a health resource. For example, e-patients participate in online health support communities to talk about problems with peers, similarly to face-to-face peer support groups (i.e., Alcoholics Anonymous). These niche social networking websites are valuable resources because of the benefits of support groups, such as inter-patient discourse and self-decision-making, improved health, and the betterment of the general quality of life. Users who participate are often motivated by the sense of community and empowerment.

Social networking in the consumer health context rapidly grew in popularity in the last decade due to advantages in inter-patient discourse, namely: allowing patients to play a more informed role in their own healthcare; gathering and sharing health information outside of their doctor’s office (Kielstra, 2009). Additionally, patients and/or their caregivers often turn to the Internet to seek additional social support, especially those with limited local resources. Frequently, e-patients use social networking platforms to teach each other about conditions and treatments (Civan and Pratt, 2007; Wright and Bell, 2003). Social networking sites are predicted to increase in popularity as a way for people to socialize online as an extension of their physical environment. Online community tools include the popular text-based communication formats from Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace such as posting status updates, discussion boards and profile pages.

While many previous studies of online support communities identified sociability factors such as types of social support (i.e. informational support, emotional support) exchanged in online support groups and health outcomes, there is a gap in research literature concerning the design of software interface architecture. The central focus of this research will investigate the impact of software features on online supportive communication behavior across multiple computer-mediated communication (CMC) formats. This research contributes insights to the effects of software features by studying supportive interactions across multiple CMC formats. Findings would be valuable to designers, and evaluators of online social software products, even domain specific applied practice as online intervention programs. Contributions from this study can apply to:

<ul>
    <li><strong><em>Practice</em>:</strong> help technologists understand restrictions and opportunities for design and implementation of social media technologies for online health support communities (i.e. online intervention programs),</li>
    <li><strong><em>Research</em>:</strong> researchers studying online communities, social networking, or social support in a virtual environment, and</li>
    <li><strong><em>Policy</em>:</strong> inform policy makers who determine practice guidelines for both design and management of online health support communities. The outcome of this study can contribute to improving online intervention programs by targeting specific functions of social network sites.</li>
